How to execute the program:

1. 
To execute the program, navigate to the src directory:
cd /home/a_0012/cada0012_beta_submission/src/

2.
Run the command in the following format:
./netlist_optimizer <netlist_file> <cell_library_file> <output_file> <cost_estimator>

example: ./netlist_optimizer ../netlists/design1.v ../lib/lib1.json output.v ../cost_estimators/cost_estimator_1

3. 
The final optimized netlist will be written to output.v, and the cost of the optimized netlist will be written to cost_output.txt

4.  
To verify the final cost, throw output.v into the cost estimator by running
